# Digital-Signal-Generation-and-Transmission
Course Design for Communication Theory and Systems

1) Random signal source generation, with 2 different measures to modulate the signal (in my case ASK & LFM). Numbers of Signals changeable.
2) Matched Filtering during the receiving process.

SNR, gate threshold (when judging if the signal is "1" or "0" during receiving) self definable. Their influence in Pe were discussed.
